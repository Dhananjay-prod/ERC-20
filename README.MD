# ERC-20 Token Implementation

This repository contains a robust implementation of the ERC-20 token standard, the most widely used fungible token protocol on the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC-20 standard defines a common interface for smart contracts to manage tokens, allowing for seamless integration across wallets, exchanges, and decentralized applications.

## Features

- **ERC-20 Compliance**: Fully adheres to the official ERC-20 specification.
- **Minting & Burning**: Supports token creation and destruction (if enabled).
- **Ownership Control**: Implements access control for administrative functions.
- **Safe Math Operations**: Prevents overflow and underflow bugs.
- **Extensible Design**: Easily customizable for advanced use cases.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16+ recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) or [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) for local blockchain development
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) for interacting with deployed contracts

### Installation

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dhananjay-prod/ERC-20.git
